   <h2>Update</h2>
<h5>Apr 27, 2023</h5>
 <b><p>Hey everyone, its been a while since I've written a blog post.  I just wanted to update you on the apps I am making.  So right now I am still trying to figure out on what Wii Homebrew app I should make.  It is kind of hard to think of a Homebrew app for me right now since there are already so much Homebrew apps out there.  For the ScratchBrowser it will still come out it is just that some of my concepts are scrapped.  I am thinking of just making a simple browser where you can just search up some games, media, and profile users.  Anyway, that's all I wanted to say about app development updates, peace!

   <h2>HB apps</h2>
<h5>Apr 6, 2023</h5>
<b><p>So, I have tried to make a couple of homebrew apps in the past but failed a couple of times this is going to be my third attempt into trying to make a homebrew app for the Wii.  I finally figured out how to get dol files and know which software to use to develop homebrew apps.</b></p>

  <h2>Scratch Browser status</h2>
<h5>Apr 5, 2023</h5>     
<b><p>I haven't built it yet as I am still working on school and all of that junk.  Once I get all of that stuff out of the way it will surely be built. I plan to release the source code of this site and also the source code of the Scratch Browser in my  GitHub.</p></b>
