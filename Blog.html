<b><p>So, I have tried to make a couple of homebrew apps in the past but failed a couple of times this is going to be my third attempt into trying to make a homebrew app for the Wii.  I finally figured out how to get dol files and know which software to use to develop homebrew apps.</b></p>

<h5>Apr 5, 2023</h5>     
<b><p>I haven't built it yet as I am still working on school and all of that junk.  Once I get all of that stuff out of the way it will surely be built. I plan to release the source code of this site and also the source code of the Scratch Browser in my  GitHub.</p></b>
