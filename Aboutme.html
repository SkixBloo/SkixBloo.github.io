<h2>About Me</h2> 
<b><p>Hi, the name's BluShuMon also know as SkieBloo.  I am a programmer, student, creator, and gamer.  I first started coding when I was in 6th grade I found out about a program called Scratch.  I still use Scratch to this day but barely make any projects all I really do on there is just chat on profiles and on the forums as well.   </p></b>
